# Docker

The Docker setup is included in this project to ensure a high level of **environmental control**. With Docker, the container includes everything required for the project to run: the operating system, Node.js version, dependencies, and configuration.

While occasional updates may still be necessary, using a container ensures that the application behaves consistently across all environments — whether running locally or deployed on an external API service.
